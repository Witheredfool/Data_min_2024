This study/project will prove the importance of mushroom classification, and provide readers with insight into the best classification for something with complex details such as mushrooms or plants. Mushroom classification is essential for mycology, but can also be used in various fields such as Agriculture, Medicine, the Veterinary field, and even foraging. For our study, we used a data set containing several different identifiers for separate mushrooms (such as gill size, cap shape, seasons of fruition, and more) which was processed and analyzed thoroughly. Our essential methodology used data preprocessing and data cleaning, feature selection and removal, the application of four classification models, and the analysis of confusion matrices and the ROC/AUC curve. The results of our study provided information on high levels of accuracy with our chosen models, this can be shown with the K-nearest neighbor model and Random forest. The project also gave us more information about our other models that cannot handle large datasets or many features. Our project highlights the effective ways to combine the world of mycology with programming in hopes of protecting native species, preventing poisonings, and allowing individuals to forage safely.  Future work will explore more forms of classification and more adjustments with dataset sizing, as well as working on methods of image recognition to enhance functionality on a more public scale.
